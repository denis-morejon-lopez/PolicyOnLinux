Installation Guide


===============In the NFS server:==================
1- Instalar NFS 
   apt-get install nfs-kernel-server

2- NFS access control in:
   /etc/exports
   (You can see an example in the file nfs/exports)

   /var/pol
   


===============In the clientes (Tested with debian and ubuntu)=================

Script to execute policies connecting to the pol folder in the NFS server

1- Install client components:
       apt-get install nfs-common python-ldap ntpdate

2- Edit /etc/crontab and add this line:

   2  *    * * *   root    /etc/policy-client.sh

   So that policies can be executed each hour.

3- Restart cron service:
   sudo /etc/init.d/cron reload
   
4- Execute the policies for the first time to see if It works (Maybe two times):
   sudo /etc/policy-client.sh

5- Verify if local log file is generated:
   tail /var/log/pol.log
   Note: The system put a general log file into the NFS server with information about all the clients
   that has executed the policies successfuly. This file is in /var/pol_log/pol.log 

6- If you see some content into /var/log/pol.log It means that all was right.
